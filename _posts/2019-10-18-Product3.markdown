## User Interface
* The sanitation workers can search for the next location and optimal route to pick up the trash.
* After arriving at the destination, the workers can upload the photos of collected trash and input the type of trash.

## Server Design
* We use graph theory to represent different trash locations.
* Then we solve the optimal path within each region for trash cleaning based on Baltimore City 311 Service Request Data.
