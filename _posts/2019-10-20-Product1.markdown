## User Interface
![ui](https://advds71x.github.io/DataSprint/img/demo1-ui.png)

* The users can search for the nearby trash cans.



## Server Design
![server](https://advds71x.github.io/DataSprint/img/demo1-server.png)

* We use the geolocation data from Baltimore City 311 Service Request Data.

* We apply clustering algorithms to find different groups of trash locations. Within each cluster, assign certain numbers of trash cans.
